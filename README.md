# Unity-animations-weapons
For a technical test I had to make a game with a few constraints. This is my submission for said test.

# How to run this project.
You are going to need Git and Unity hub to open this project and use it. Once you have those two tools installed follow the next instructions:

## Clone the repository
Since this repository is public you can to clone it easily, to do that open a terminal on the folder where you'd like to save the project and then run:
```Zsh
git clone https://github.com/cawolfkreo/Unity-animations-weapons.git
```

## Set up Unity
This project was made using Unity version 2020.13.15f2. On unity Hub you need to click on the **Install** section of the tool, then on the **Add** button and after that, choose any of the 2020 LTS versions of unity and then click on **Next**. Follow the rest of the installation process.

Once you have Unity installed, go to the Unity hub and on the **Projects** section click on the **Add** button, open the folder where you cloned the repository and then select the folder created by git. Once you finished with this you can open the project. If your version of Unity is newer than the project's version, Unity will prompt you to update the project, do so and once it's done, you can start using it.

# The weapons
So far the game only has 3 weapons and those are:
1. **Prabolic weapon:** it shoots projectiles affected by gravity, is the base for all the other weapons.
2. **Gravity weapon:** it affects objects that are close to it, when shoot it will attract other objects to it and, if everything works correctly, those objects will orbit the projectile of the weapon.
3. **Granade launcher:** [it launches grenades](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxb7ukL_WJJicDuJcfCtG4IFzn1VxwicJo) when shoot the projectile will travel until it touches the floor and then it will explode, pushing away every other object close enough to it to be hit by the explosion.
